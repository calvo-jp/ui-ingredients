# Introduction

UI ingredients is a headless component library for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) powered by [zag](https://zagjs.com/)

## Features

- **Unstyled by Default**

UI Ingredients gives you complete control over your design. With no pre-applied styles, you can seamlessly integrate your own custom aesthetics using `class` props or data attributes.

- **Fully Customizable**

With an extensive set of props and event handlers, each component adapts to your application's unique requirements, giving you the freedom to create dynamic, interactive interfaces.

- **Built for Accessibility**

Accessibility is at the core of UI Ingredients. All components follow best practices for screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and focus management to ensure an inclusive experience for all users.
